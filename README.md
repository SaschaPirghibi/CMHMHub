Data Collection and Integration
  Wearable Sensors
    Design and Deployment:
      Sensor Selection: Choose sensors that can measure vital health metrics such as body temperature, heart rate, hydration levels, and environmental factors like ambient temperature and humidity.
      Deployment Strategy: Develop a strategy for distributing and attaching sensors to pregnant women, ensuring comfort and minimal disruption to daily activities.
    Data Transmission:
      Wireless Communication: Use Bluetooth or other wireless technologies for continuous data transmission.
      Data Security: Implement encryption and secure transmission protocols to protect sensitive health data.
  External Data Sources
    Meteorological Data:
      APIs: Integrate with reliable weather APIs (e.g., NOAA, Weather.com) for real-time and historical temperature data.
      Data Frequency: Ensure frequent updates to capture dynamic changes in weather conditions.
    GIS Data:
      Sources: Utilize GIS data from public databases (e.g., USGS, OpenStreetMap) and local government sources.
      Layer Integration: Combine multiple layers of data (e.g., topography, population density) for comprehensive heat mapping.
Data Processing and Storage
  Data Pipeline
    ETL Processes:
      Extraction: Collect data from wearable sensors, meteorological APIs, GIS databases, and healthcare records.
      Transformation: Cleanse data, normalize formats, and integrate data from heterogeneous sources.
      Loading: Load processed data into centralized storage systems for analysis.
    Data Lakes and Warehouses:
      Data Lakes: Cloud-based data lakes (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake) are used to store raw, unstructured data.
      Data Warehouses: Implement relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data, enabling efficient querying and reporting.
Data Analysis and Visualization
  Heat Mapping
    GIS Software:
      Tools: Utilize tools like ArcGIS, QGIS, or Google Earth Engine for creating and analyzing heat maps.
      Spatial Analysis: Perform spatial analysis to identify patterns and correlations between temperature anomalies and health outcomes.
    Machine Learning Models:
      Predictive Analytics: Develop machine learning models (e.g., regression, clustering) to predict high-risk periods and regions.
      Training Data: Use historical data to train models, ensuring accurate predictions.
  Health Monitoring
    Real-Time Analysis:
      Anomaly Detection: Implement algorithms to detect deviations in health metrics, triggering alerts for potential health risks.
      Data Fusion: Combine health data with environmental data to provide a holistic view of conditions affecting pregnant women.
    Visualization Dashboards:
      Tools: Use BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or custom web dashboards for real-time data visualization.
      User Interface: Design intuitive interfaces for healthcare providers to monitor patient health and environmental conditions.
